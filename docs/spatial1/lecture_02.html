  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>
    Let's go over your initial ideas for apps in groups. Who wants to go first?
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's watch two videos from my laptop that Apple has deleted from it's WWDC video site:
    <ul>
      <li>"Prototyping for AR" (11 minutes)</li>
      <li>"Presenting Design Work" (16 minutes)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    Next, another WWDC video:
    <br />
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/818/">"60-Second Prototyping" (11 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how to quickly build interactive prototypes! See how you can test new ideas and improve upon existing ones with minimal time investment and using tools you are already familiar with."
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's read and discuss this 2022 article from developer.apple.com <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=97dgimaa">"Meet the prototypers"</a>.
  </div>
  <div>Let's watch a video all about Apple's prototyping process.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2014/223/">"Prototyping: Fake It Till You Make It" (58 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Make better apps by trying things out first, before you write any code. Get a glimpse of Apple's prototyping process and the range of tools and techniques we use, some of which might surprise you."
  </div>
  <div>
    Next, another video from WWDC:
    <br />
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10126/">"Discoverable design" (33 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Discover how you can create interactive, memorable experiences to onboard people into your app. We'll take you through discoverable design practices and learn how you can craft explorable, fun interfaces that help people grasp the possibilities of your app at a glance. We'll also show you how to apply this methodology to personalize your content and make your app easy to customize."
  </div>
  <div>
    To finish with, let's work on the following:
    <ol>
      <li>What questions do you have for me?</li>
      <li>Start thinking about three users from page 15 of the <a href="https://education-static.apple.com/coding-club-kit/appworkbook.key">App Design Workbook</a>. Let's take a quick look at this slide together. You'll present this in two weeks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Start thinking about an (initial) paper prototype of your app! You'll also present this in two weeks. Do you know how to capture a video from a Vision Pro? <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/apple-vision-pro/tan1527c9e00/visionos">This Apple article takes you through it</a>, let me demo and also how to transfer the video to your laptop to be added to Keynote.

        In addition, please review all of the content from today's lecture.
