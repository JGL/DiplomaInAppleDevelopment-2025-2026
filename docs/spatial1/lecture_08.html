  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>
    Let's start by going over your App Design Workbook work in groups. Who wants to go first?

  </div>
  <div>Let's continue by watching a video from WWDC.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10102/">"Compose interactive 3D content in Reality Composer Pro" (35 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Discover how the Timeline view in Reality Composer Pro can bring your 3D content to life. Learn how to create an animated story in which characters and objects interact with each other and the world around them using inverse kinematics, blend shapes, and skeletal poses. We'll also show you how to use built-in and custom actions, sequence your actions, apply triggers, and implement natural movements."
    <br />
    Let's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/composing-interactive-3d-content-with-realitykit-and-reality-composer-pro">download the content from the presentation, and work through it</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's try building our own timelines in Reality Composer Pro - I'm particularly interested in showing how to trigger timelines interactively in Reality Composer Pro. What component shall we use for that? <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitycomposerpro/adding-assets-into-your-reality-composer-pro-scene#Add-components-to-entities">How would you make a new Component</a>?
  </div>
  <div>What questions do you have for me?</div>
  <div>
    Next week, we'll move on from the second third of Spatial 1 (Reality Composer Pro) into the final third (SwiftUI and RealityKit). Please review all of the content from today's lecture before then - if we have time, let's start working on the next parts of the App Design Workbook (to be presented in two lecture's time):
