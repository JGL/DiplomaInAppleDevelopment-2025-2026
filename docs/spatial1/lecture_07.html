  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's start by trying out <a href="https://poly.cam">Polycam</a>. Please <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/polycam-3d-scanner-lidar-360/id1532482376">download the app for your iPhone</a>. Please DM me on Slack for my login - kindly gifted to us by the CEO of Polycam, <a href="https://www.ebspelman.com">Elliott Spelman</a>. Remember that we want to be be able to export USDZ files at the end of this, let's take a look at this article: <a href="https://learn.poly.cam/hc/en-us/articles/27756102599572-What-File-Types-Can-Polycam-Export">"What File Types Can Polycam Export?"</a>. Let's work through this article together: <a href="https://learn.poly.cam/hc/en-us/articles/27425185907348-Creating-Photogrammetry-Captures-in-Object-Mode">"Creating Photogrammetry Captures in Object Mode"</a>.</div>
  <div>Let's continue by going through the (in)famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0J27sf9N1Y">Donut (sic) tutorial for learning Blender</a> from <a href="https://www.blenderguru.com">Blender Guru aka Andrew Price</a>. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0J27sf9N1Y&list=PLjEaoINr3zgEPv5y--4MKpciLaoQYZB1Z">full playlist is over 5 hours long</a>, but you can watch that outside of class if you'd like to. Does anyone know how to use Blender already?</div>
  <div>Now let's continue by taking our USDZ files from Polycam or Blender (or both) into Reality Composer Pro, and adding an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/anchoringcomponent">Anchoring Component</a> to them, before trying them on device! What kind of anchors are selectable in Reality Composer Pro?</div>
  <div>What questions do you have for me?</div>
  <div>
