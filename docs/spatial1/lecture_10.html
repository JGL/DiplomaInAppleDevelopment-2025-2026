  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>
    Let's start by going over your <a href="https://education-static.apple.com/coding-club-kit/appworkbook.key">App Design Workbook</a> work in groups. Who wants to go first?

  <div>Let's continue by watching more videos about <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit">RealityKit</a>.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10080/">"Build spatial experiences with RealityKit" (28 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Discover how RealityKit can bring your apps into a new dimension. Get started with RealityKit entities, components, and systems, and learn how you can add 3D models and effects to your app on visionOS. We'll also take you through the RealityView API and demonstrate how to add 3D objects to windows, volumes, and spaces to make your apps more immersive. And we'll explore combining RealityKit with spatial input, animation, and spatial audio."
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10111/">"Go beyond the window with SwiftUI" (24 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Get ready to launch into space ‚Äî a new SwiftUI scene type that can help you make great immersive experiences for visionOS. We'll show you how to create a new scene with ImmersiveSpace, place 3D content, and integrate RealityView. Explore how you can use the immersionStyle scene modifier to increase the level of immersion in an app and learn best practices for managing spaces, adding virtual hands with ARKit, adding support for SharePlay, and building an "out of this world" experience!"
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10081/">"Enhance your spatial computing app with RealityKit" (21 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Go beyond the window and learn how you can bring engaging and immersive 3D content to your apps with RealityKit. Discover how SwiftUI scenes work in tandem with RealityView and how you can embed your content into an entity hierarchy. We'll also explore how you can blend virtual content and the real world using anchors, bring particle effects into your apps, add video content, and create more immersive experiences with portals."
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's take a look at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/visionos/get-started/#building-blocks">"Learn the building blocks of spatial computing"</a> part of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/visionos/get-started/">visionOS Pathway</a>:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/adding-3d-content-to-your-app/">"Adding 3D content to your app"</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/creating-your-first-visionos-app/">"Creating your first visionOS app"</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/creating-fully-immersive-experiences/">"Creating fully immersive experiences in your app"</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Let's move onto how to make icons for your app, as well as another app to use for iconography within your app.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/220/">"Say hello to the new look of app icons" (12 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Get an overview of the new app icon appearances for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, including light and dark tints, and clear options. Learn how to use frostiness and translucency to make your app icon more vibrant, dynamic, and expressive, and find out how to ensure your icon works well with specular highlights."
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/361/">"Create icons with Icon Composer" (15 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Get an overview of the new app icon appearances for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, including light and dark tints, and clear options.

  </div>
  <div>Let's take a look at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/">Apple Design Resources part of the Design section of the Apple Developer website</a>. As well as lots of fonts and templates for tools like Figma, Sketch, Photoshop and Illustrator, there are links to download <a href="https://developer.apple.com/icon-composer/">Icon Composer</a> as well as my favourite, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/">SF Symbols</a>.</div>
  <div>What questions do you have for me?</div>
