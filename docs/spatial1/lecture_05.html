  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's start by watching some videos from WWDC.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10086/">"Design great visionOS apps" (20 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Find out how to create compelling spatial computing apps by embracing immersion, designing for eyes and hands, and taking advantage of depth, scale, and space. We'll share several examples of great visionOS apps and explore how their designers approached creating new experiences for the platform."
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10096/">"Design interactive experiences for visionOS" (21 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how you can design a compelling interactive narrative experience for Apple Vision Pro from the designers of Encounter Dinosaurs. Discover how these types of experiences differ from existing apps, media, and games, and explore how to design narratives that bring audiences into new worlds. Find out how you can create stories that adapt to any space and size, provide multiple levels of interaction to make them accessible to all, and use animation, spatial audio, and custom gestures to further immerse people in your experience."
  </div>
  <div>Let's continue by reminding ourselves <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit">what RealityKit is, and how it relates to ARKit</a>. We'll be going into much more detail on ARKit in Coding 2 in Block 2. Recall that RealityKit has a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/understanding-the-realitykit-modular-architecture">modular architecture - entities, components and systems (ECS)</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">ECS is used in many games and game engines</a>. Let's read this <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/implementing-systems-for-entities-in-a-scene">article that goes into more detail on implementing systems in RealityKit</a>. Recall that it's possible to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionOS/creating-fully-immersive-experiences">have multiple fully immersive RealityKit scenes in a single app</a>.</div>
  <div>Let's continue by exploring Apple's app for creating RealityKit content: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitycomposerpro">Reality Composer Pro</a>.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10083/">"Meet Reality Composer Pro" (22 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Discover how to easily compose, edit, and preview 3D content with Reality Composer Pro. Follow along as we explore this developer tool by setting up a new project, composing scenes, adding particle emitters and audio, and even previewing content on device. Once you're familiar with the basics of Reality Composer Pro, check out "Explore Materials in Reality Composer Pro" and "Work with Reality Composer Pro content in Xcode" to learn more advanced techniques and tips."
    <br />
    Let's mirror the video by copying it on our own machines.

  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202/">"Explore Materials in Reality Composer Pro" (21 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how Reality Composer Pro can help you alter the appearance of your 3D objects using RealityKit materials. We'll introduce you to MaterialX and physically-based (PBR) shaders, show you how to design dynamic materials using the shader graph editor, and explore adding custom inputs to a material so that you can control it in your visionOS app. To get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching ‚ÄúMeet Reality Composer Pro.‚Äù Once you're ready to learn how you can incorporate your models and materials into an Xcode project, check out "Work with Reality Composer Pro content in Xcode."

  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10273/">"Work with Reality Composer Pro content in Xcode" (35 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how to bring content from Reality Composer Pro to life in Xcode. We'll show you how to load 3D scenes into Xcode, integrate your content with your code, and add interactivity to your app. We'll also share best practices and tips for using these tools together in your development workflow. To get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching ‚ÄúMeet Reality Composer Pro‚Äù and ‚ÄúExplore materials in Reality Composer Pro" to learn more about creating 3D scenes."
