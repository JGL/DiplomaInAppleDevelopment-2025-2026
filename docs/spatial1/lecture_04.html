  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>
    Let's start by going over your initial ideas for apps in groups. Who wants to go first?
    <ol>
      <li>Three users from page 15 of the <a href="https://education-static.apple.com/coding-club-kit/appworkbook.key">App Design Workbook</a>.</li>
      <li>An (initial) paper prototype of your app!</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's continue with a video from WWDC:
    <br />
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10275/">"The practice of inclusive design" (35 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "An inclusive app or game is not only usable by different people, but also welcomes people from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Discover how you can design inclusive content for your interface, language, imagery, and marketing materials and support the broadest possible range of people with your app or game."
  </div>
  <div>
    And another video from WWDC:
    <br />
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10304/">"The process of inclusive design" (37 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Discover how you can deliver inclusive apps that can foster amazing experiences for everyone who uses your software. We'll take you through best practices for creating and empowering diverse teams and explore how inclusivity influences every stage of the design and development process."
  </div>
  <div>
    Another video from WWDC, this time from 2025:
    <br />
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/316/">"Principles of Inclusive App Design" (22 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Discover how understanding disability can help you create better apps for everyone. Find out how to make your apps more inclusive by supporting multiple types of interaction, providing customization, and adopting accessibility APIs."
  </div>
  <div>
    Another video from WWDC, specifically about visionOS:
    <br />
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10078/">"Design considerations for vision and motion" (15 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how to design engaging immersive experiences for visionOS that respect the limitations of human vision and motion perception. We'll show you how you can use depth cues, contrast, focus, and motion to keep people comfortable as they enjoy your apps and games."
  </div>
  <div>Let's continue by reading about some of <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-announces-new-accessibility-features-including-eye-tracking/">the latest accessibility features from Apple</a>.</div>
  <div>I'm really interested by the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position">the veil of ignorance</a>, as well as the story about wheelchair access in the UK.</div>
  <div>
    Let's take a look at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/inclusion/">HIG's guidelines around inclusion</a>, as well as the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/applestyleguide/apdcb2a65d68/web">Style Guide's section on inclusive writing</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    Another video from WWDC:
    <br />
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10034/">"Create accessible spatial experiences" (26 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how you can make spatial computing apps that work well for everyone. Like all Apple platforms, visionOS is designed for accessibility: We'll share how we've reimagined assistive technologies like VoiceOver and Pointer Control and designed features like Dwell Control to help people interact in the way that works best for them. Learn best practices for vision, motor, cognitive, and hearing accessibility and help everyone enjoy immersive experiences for visionOS."

    Next week, we'll move on from the first third of Spatial 1 (Design) into the second third (Reality Composer Pro). In two weeks, you will be presenting your group projects again. Let's start working on the following together (please continue in your groups over the next week!)
