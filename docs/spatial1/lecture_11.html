  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's start with a video from WWDC 2024 about RealityKit for iOS, macOS and visionOS.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10103/">"Discover RealityKit APIs for iOS, macOS and visionOS" (32 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how new cross-platform APIs in RealityKit can help you build immersive apps for iOS, macOS, and visionOS. Check out the new hover effects, lights and shadows, and portal crossing features, and view them in action through real examples."

    Together, let's continue Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/welcome-to-develop-in-swift-tutorials">Develop in Swift Tutorials</a> from Coding 1 - moving onto: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/welcome-to-spatial-computing">Welcome to spatial computing</a>, continuing to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/add-depth-to-your-app">Add depth to your app</a>, before finishing with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/windows-in-visionos-conclusion">Wrap-up: Windows in visionOS</a>.

  <div>Let's move on to working through some of Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/introductory-visionos-samples">Introductory visionOS samples</a> - remixing existing code is a completely valid way of making new apps!
