  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's start by watching some WWDC videos about SwiftUI.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10001/">"Explore navigation design for iOS" (25 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Familiar navigation patterns can help people easily explore the information within your app ‚Äî and save them from unnecessary confusion. We'll show you how to take advantage of existing navigation structures to simplify complex interactions in your app without compromising its personality. Learn best practices and common pitfalls when working with tab bars, modality, and more."
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10149/">"Work with windows in SwiftUI" (13 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how to create great single and multi-window apps in visionOS, macOS, and iPadOS. Discover tools that let you programmatically open and close windows, adjust position and size, and even replace one window with another. We'll also explore design principles for windows that help people use your app within their workflows."
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10115/">"Design with SwiftUI" (20 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Discover how SwiftUI can help you quickly iterate and explore design ideas. Learn from Apple designers as they share how working with SwiftUI influenced the design of the Maps app in watchOS 10 and other elements of their work, and find out how you can incorporate these workflows in your own process"
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10109/">"Meet SwiftUI for spatial computing" (26 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Take a tour of the solar system with us and explore SwiftUI for visionOS! Discover how you can build an entirely new universe of apps with windows, volumes, and spaces. We'll show you how to get started with SwiftUI on this platform as we build an astronomy app, add 3D content, and create a fully immersive experience to transport people to the stars."
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10110">"Elevate your windowed app for spatial computing" (16 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Discover how you can bring your multiplatform SwiftUI app to visionOS and the Shared Space. We'll show you how to add the visionOS destination to an existing app and view your app in the Simulator. Explore how your SwiftUI code automatically adapts to support the unique context and presentation of the visionOS platform. Learn how you can update custom views, improve your app's UI, and add features and controls specific to this platform."
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10260/">"Get started with building apps for spatial computing" (32 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Get ready to develop apps and games for visionOS! Discover the fundamental building blocks that make up spatial computing ‚Äî windows, volumes, and spaces ‚Äî and find out how you can use these elements to build engaging and immersive experiences."
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10203/">"Develop your first immersive app" (32 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Find out how you can build immersive apps for visionOS using Xcode and Reality Composer Pro. We'll show you how to get started with a new visionOS project, use Xcode Previews for your SwiftUI development, and take advantage of RealityKit and RealityView to render 3D content."
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10113/">"Take SwiftUI to the next dimension" (20 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Get ready to add depth and dimension to your visionOS apps. Find out how to bring three-dimensional objects to your app using volumes, get to know the Model 3D API, and learn how to position and animate content. We'll also show you how to use UI attachments in RealityView and support gestures in your content."
