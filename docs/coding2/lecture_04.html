		👋🏻 Hi!
	</div>
	<div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
	<div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
	<div>Let's start by watching this video from WWDC23: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10149/">Discover Observation in SwiftUI</a>.</div>
	<div>Please open up Xcode as we are going to do a new activity, a "Code-along" from Apple: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/meet-with-apple/237/">Start building with Swift and SwiftUI</a>.</div>
	<div>Let's continue by watching this video from WWDC23: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10187/">Meet SwiftData</a>.</div>
	<div>Let's finish by reviewing the following articles from developer.apple.com:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/model-data">The basic concepts of data within SwiftUI</a> - having a single source of truth in your app - aka a data Model. Why might it be important to have a single source of truth?</li>
			<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/migrating-from-the-observable-object-protocol-to-the-observable-macro">Migrating from the Observable Object protocol to the Observable macro</a> - this is useful to read because you might find some old example code from Apple that uses the old way of doing things.</li>
			<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/managing-model-data-in-your-app">Managing model data in your app</a> - create connections between your app’s data model and views, using the @Observable macro. Is everyone clear on what a macro is?</li>
			<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/preserving-your-apps-model-data-across-launches">Preserving your app’s model data across launches</a> - let's review your knowledge of SwiftData.</li>
			<li>Finally, realise that if you use the Xcode template for a visionOS app, with RealityKit as the Immersive Space Renderer and a Mixed Immersive space, you get an @Observable AppModel class automatically, and both the ContentView and ImmersiveView are passed the AppModel via the .environment modifier, in the App structure.</li>
		</ul>
