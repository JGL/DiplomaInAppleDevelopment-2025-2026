		👋🏻 Hi!
	</div>
	<div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
	<div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
	<div>
		Let's watch this session from WWDC23:
		<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10082/">"Meet ARKit for spatial computing"</a>.
	</div>
	<div>
		As mentioned in that session, you need to authorise your app to track hands and sense the world, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/setting-up-access-to-arkit-data">here is an article about how to do that</a>.
	</div>
	<div>
		Let's watch this session from WWDC24:
		<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10100/">"Create enhanced spatial computing experiences with ARKit"</a>.
	</div>
	<div>
		Next, let's watch this session from WWDC24:
		<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10104/">"Build a spatial drawing app with RealityKit"</a>.
		<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/creating-a-spatial-drawing-app-with-realitykit">The complete source code for this app is available</a>, but I recommend starting with reviewing
		<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/tracking-and-visualizing-hand-movement">this introductory visionOS sample: "Tracking and visualizing(sic) hand movement"</a>
		, before moving onto <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/creating-a-painting-space-in-visionos">this introductory visionOS sample: "Creating a 3D painting space"</a>. This last one uses Metal, is a low level library to do super optimised 3D and even ML on Apple platforms. It's beyond the scope of this course.
