		👋🏻 Hi!
	</div>
	<div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
	<div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
	<div>Let's start by watching this video from WWDC25: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/288/">Bring your SceneKit project to RealityKit</a>.</div>
	<div>See the linked article: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/bringing-your-scenekit-projects-to-realitykit">Bringing your SceneKit projects to RealityKit</a> - download Pyro Panda to your Xcode and let's try it on headset - you'll need your Playstation controllers don't forget. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/111100">Here is an article on how to pair controllers with headsets</a>.</div>
	<div>As an aside, let's learn about Swift Packages. Packages are an easy way to use other programmer's code, but also to package up your code for others to use.</div>
	<div>Le't watch this video from WWDC19: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/408/">"Adopting Swift Packages in Xcode"</a>. You'll notice that Apple uses packages for Reality Composer Pro content when you use the RealityKit template in Xcode. </div>
	<div>Take a look at <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com">The Swift Package Index</a>, a community run but Apple sponsored website.</div>
	<div>N.B. If you want to learn more about how to create Swift Packages, see this talk: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/410/">"Creating Swift Packages"</a>, but that's beyond the scope of this course).</div>
	<div>Now let's review <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/bringing-your-scenekit-projects-to-realitykit">that article in detail</a>, and dive into the code. Who wants to start by coming up to the front? Don't worry, I'll keep rotating people every 5 minutes. Start the countdown!</div>
	<div>
		Thanks! As always, please review all today's content as homework.<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
