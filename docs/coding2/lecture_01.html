		👋🏻 Hi! Welcome to Block 2! Well done on completing Block One! 🎉
	</div>
	<div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
	<div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
	<div>Let's start by looking at the homepage for Block 2, which is below that of Block 1: <a href="https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2025-2026/">https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2025-2026/</a>.
	</div>
	<div>
		Let's move on by reviewing the README.md for Block 2 on the Apple Diploma GitHub: <a href="https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2025-2026/">https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2025-2026/</a>. Don't forget to make note of the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2025-2026/#block-2-assessment">assessment schedule</a> in your own calendars. As you know from Block One, assessment will be upon you before you know it! Tutorials will continue as normal on Monday mornings - please mark these in your calendars too - I'll post reminders on Fridays.
	</div>
	<div>
		Let's continue by looking at the wiki for Block 2 on the Apple Diploma GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2025-2026/wiki">https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2025-2026/wiki</a>, paying particular attention to the external resources page: <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2025-2026/wiki/External-Resources">https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2025-2026/wiki/External-Resources</a>

	<div>Block 2 is going to be different to Block 1, based on feedback from your course representatives. Coding 2 is going to be all about tearing apart Apple example code as a group, with you taking control some of the time. Spatial 2 is going to be much more like a studio, with each of you developing your own playful app, based around a key spatial moment. Please ask questions - don't be afraid to ask when you don't understand - that's on me, not you!</div>
	<div>I want you all to get comfortable exploring WWDC videos and the example code and article sections of each of these APIs: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos">visionOS</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/">RealityKit</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a>. Remember how to find example code and articles within a specific part of developer.apple.com? I'd also like you to explore all of the content on <a href="https://stepinto.vision">Step Into Vision</a> - there is source code and articles available there for just about anything you can do on visionOS. Make use of these resources!</div>
	<div>Remember that hand and other RealityKit anchor based interactions are only useable when using the headset - not in the simulator. That's why it's really important to get into a regular schedule of time with a headset - I'd suggest doing this on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday afternoons. Remember you'll need to book out the headset from the technician on duty and return it before the end of the day - I'd aim for 1400-1700. Perhaps find a buddy to work with regularly? I'd suggest at least one afternoon a week to work together, testing each other's work and supporting each other. Friday presentations will be all about presenting the work that you've done in the past two weeks. Any questions?</div>
	<div>We are going to start with the latest code, which is the most useful to you in Spatial 2, before going back in time to earlier examples.</div>
	<div>Let's start as we mean to go on, by first reviewing a video from WWDC25: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/287/">What’s new in RealityKit</a>.</div>
	<div>Now, let's all download the linked example code: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/integrating-virtual-objects-with-your-environment">Integrating virtual objects with your environment aka Tiny Treasure Trove</a>. First thing to do is to get it building on your computers - do you get a build error too? What version of macOS and Xcode are you running? I have a fix!</div>
	<div>Now let's tear this app apart - who wants to start by coming up to the front? Don't worry, I'll keep rotating people every 5 minutes. Start the countdown!</div>
	<div>
		Thanks! As always, please review all today's content as homework.<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
