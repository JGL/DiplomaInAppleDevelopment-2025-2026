		👋🏻 Hi!
	</div>
	<div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
	<div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
	<div>Let's start by watching this video from WWDC24: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10103/">Discover RealityKit APIs for iOS, macOS, and visionOS</a>.</div>
	<div>See the linked article: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/creating-a-spaceship-game">Creating a Spaceship game</a> - download Canyon Crosser to your Xcode and let's try it on headset.</div>
	<div>Now let's review <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/creating-a-spaceship-game">that code in detail</a>. Who wants to start by coming up to the front? Don't worry, I'll keep rotating people every 5 minutes. Start the countdown!</div>
	<div>
		Thanks! As always, please review all today's content as homework.<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
