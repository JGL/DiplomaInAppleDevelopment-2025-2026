		👋🏻 Hi!
	</div>
	<div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
	<div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
	<div>Let's start by watching this video from WWDC25: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/274/">Better together: SwiftUI and RealityKit</a>. As always, <a href="https://stepinto.vision">Step Into Vision</a> has a good article about this: <a href="https://stepinto.vision/labs/lab-063-first-look-at-entity-observation/">Lab 063 – First look at Entity Observation</a>. It's a good practice to get familiar with all the example code, labs and articles on Step Into Vision - bookmark it!</div>
	<div>See the linked article: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionOS/canyon-crosser-building-a-volumetric-hike-planning-app">Canyon Crosser: Building a volumetric hike-planning app</a> - download Canyon Crosser to your Xcode and let's try it on headset.</div>
	<div>Before going into the article and code in detail, let's watch this video from WWDC25: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/273/">Meet SwiftUI spatial layout</a>.</div>
	<div>Now let's review <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionOS/canyon-crosser-building-a-volumetric-hike-planning-app">that article in detail</a>, and dive into the code. Who wants to start by coming up to the front? Don't worry, I'll keep rotating people every 5 minutes. Start the countdown! Also, see this article from Step Into Vision: <a href="https://stepinto.vision/labs/lab-067-exploring-custom-layouts-in-swiftui/">Exploring custom Layouts in SwiftUI</a> to see how the developer pulled code from Canyon Crosser.</div>
