		👋🏻 Hi!
	</div>
	<div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
	<div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
	<div>Let's start by watching this video from WWDC25: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/317/">What’s new in visionOS 26</a>.</div>
	<div>Let's continue by downloading and running the linked app on visionOS: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionOS/petite-asteroids-building-a-volumetric-visionos-game">Petite Asteroids</a>. Let's review the whole article together first. Then, who wants to start by coming up to the front? Don't worry, I'll keep rotating people every 5 minutes. Start the countdown! An Apple employee told me to pay particular attending to the Swift Packages that Petite Asteroids has - these may be very useful for your own playful apps!</div>
	<div>
		Thanks! As always, please review all today's content as homework.<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
