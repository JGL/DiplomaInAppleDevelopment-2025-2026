  <div>
    üëãüèª Hi!
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>
    Don't forget you have a tour of the library with Benelia at 1400 this afternoon! Do you all know where the library is?
  </div>
  <div>What is Swift? Let's look at the Swift homepage, which is at: <a href="https://www.swift.org">https://www.swift.org</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)">What does Wikipedia say about Swift</a>?</div>
  <div>
    What does Apple say about Swift? Let's look at the Swift page on developer.apple.com: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">https://developer.apple.com/swift/</a>
  </div>
  <div>Apple's new approach to collecting all their videos, documentation and resources are known as Pathways. You can see all the Pathways at: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/pathways/">https://developer.apple.com/pathways/</a>. Let's take a look at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/pathway/">Swift Pathway, at https://developer.apple.com/swift/pathway/</a>.</div>
  <div>Swift isn't just for making apps on Apple hardware, you can also use it to make <a href="https://thebrowser.company">cross platform web browsers</a>, <a href="https://vapor.codes">web applications</a> or <a href="https://www.swift.org/blog/byte-sized-swift-tiny-games-playdate/">games</a> for the <a href="https://play.date">Playdate</a>.</div>
  <div>Let's go through the <a href="https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2025-2026/">Block One lectures in Coding One</a>.</div>
  <div>Time for a Keynote from Develop in Swift Fundamentals, part of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/education/higher-education/app-development/">Develop in Swift curriculum</a>, "Introduction to Swift and Playgrounds". As well as the book, you can download all the content from the book by looking at the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2025-2026/wiki/External-Resources#apple-textbooks">Apple Textbooks section of the Apple Diploma wiki</a>.</div>
  <div>Another Keynote from Develop in Swift Fundamentals, "Constants, Variables and Data Types". What does the <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language">Swift Book</a> say about <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/thebasics">Constants, Variables and Data Types</a>? By the way, whenever I'm writing Swift, I find it REALLY useful to have <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour">A Swift Tour</a> open in a browser window. I recommend you do the same.</div>
  <div>One more Develop in Swift Fundamentals Keynote, "Operators". What does the <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language">Swift Book</a> say about <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/basicoperators">Operators</a>?</div>
  <div>What is SwiftUI? Let's see what <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swiftui/">Apple says about SwiftUI</a>. What <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui">documentation</a> is available for SwiftUI? What does the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/pathways/swiftui/">SwiftUI Pathway</a> contain?</div>
  <div>Every year, Apple hosts a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference">World Wide Developers Conference</a> aka WWDC aka Dub Dub. It's the place where Apple debuts new technology that you (their developers) can use to make new software. Most sessions from WWDC are archived at: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/">https://developer.apple.com/videos/</a>. As well as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/pathways/">Pathways</a> and the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/education/higher-education/app-development/">Develop in Swift curriculum</a> we will be making extensive use of them over the next academic year. They are a really well produced free resource that you'll be able to reference this year and onwards in your developer career.</div>
  <div>An important thing to remember is that Apple is always revising its code, meaning that often videos and other content can become out of date. This is another of the joys of becoming a programmer - life long learning!</div>
  <div>Let's start our WWDC video exploration with:
    <div>
      <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10150/">"SwiftUI essentials" (24 mins)</a>
    </div>
    <div>"Join us n a tour of SwiftUI, Apple's declarative user interface framework. Learn essential concepts for building apps in SwiftUI, like views, state variables, and layout. Discover the breadth of APIs for building fully featured experiences and crafting unique custom components. Whether you're brand new to SwiftUI or an experienced developer, you'll learn how to take advantage of what SwiftUI has to offer when building great apps."
    </div>
    <div>I'm going to pause the video alot to demonstrate what the presenter is doing. I'd like you to follow along too - do you all have Xcode installed? Do you have the visionOS simulator installed? Let's make sure everyone does before we start the video.</div>
  </div>
  <div>Finally, let's complete the <a href="https://www.swift.org/getting-started/swiftui/">Build an iOS app with SwiftUI guide from Swift.org</a> - let's do it all together as before.</div>
  <div>
    Don't forget you have a tour of the library with Benelia at 1400 this afternoon! Do you all know where the library is?
  </div>
  <div>Homework:
    <ol>
      <li>Review today's content.</li>
      <li>Complete the three playgrounds from today's lectures from Develop in Swift Fundamentals: Lab - Introduction.playground, Lab - Constants and Variables.playground and Lab - Operators.playground. Don't forget completed versions can be found in the Teacher.zip download. Check the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2025-2026/wiki/External-Resources#apple-textbooks">wiki</a> for download links.</li>
      <li>Slack me with any problems or queries. See you on Friday for the next Spatial lecture, the next ML lecture is first, on Thursday from 0930.</li>
    </ol>
