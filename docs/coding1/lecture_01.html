  </div>
  <div>The lecturers on the Apple Diploma</div>
  <div>
    There are two lecturers on the Apple Diploma, me and <a href="https://www.xiaowan-yi.com">Xiaowan-Yi</a>. She'll be teaching you all about Machine Learning (ML). Let's go through <a href="https://joelgethinlewis.com">my website</a> and <a href="https://www.xiaowan-yi.com">Xiaowan's</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's go around the room and introduce ourselves. Please say how you'd like to be addressed, what course you are coming from and what you are interested in making this year.
  </div>
  <div>A vibe check</div>
  <div>Now it's time for a <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/vibe-check">vibe check</a>. I'm going to make a commitment to be here in person all day, every Tuesday and Friday, ready to start at 0930. I'd like you to make the same commitment too (for Thursdays too!) - to each other as much as to me. We all have different needs and different commutes. Is it possible? Let's talk it over. Why might it be hard to get in at 0930?</div>
  <div>What people have made on this course before</div>
  <div>
    Let's take a look at the results of the last three years of the Apple Diploma, from the end of year shows:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://vimeo.com/joelgethinlewis/applediploma2022-2023">2022/2023 cohort</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://vimeo.com/joelgethinlewis/applediploma2023-2024">2023/2024 cohort</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://vimeo.com/joelgethinlewis/applediploma2024-2025">2024/2025 cohort</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    Are you all on the CCI Slack? If so, let's move on to confirming your attendance in this class! This will be your responsibility to do in every class that you attend. If you miss classes, you will be contacted by the CCI admin team. This is important not just for your learning, but most importantly for your welfare.
    <ol>
      <li>Download the Seats Mobile app from the iOS app store.</li>
      <li>Login with your UAL ID.</li>
      <li>Say yes to all the permission requests - notifications, Bluetooth (make sure it's turned on) and location.</li>
      <li>Then you should be able to simply check in.</li>
      <li>If you get stuck, message me on Slack for <a href="https://artslondon.sharepoint.com/:u:/s/CCI/Technical/EQM-3j0fmAZChArvPTezuLQBJEHO9eKyPTj2tnp6pe_FVw?e=hOPSDI">Student Guide</a> or <a href="https://ual.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c95aa6f4-39ef-45ef-96a9-af1b014550a2">a video guide</a>.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Next, let's go around the room and re-introduce ourselves, with how you like to be addressed, how you are feeling today and which BA you are on at UAL.</p>
    <p>
      Let's take a look at the
      <a href="https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2025-2026/">Diploma homepage</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2025-2026/">GitHub readme.md</a> and finally the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2025-2026/wiki">GitHub wiki</a>.
      Please send me your GitHub ID's on Slack and I'll add you to the GitHub, so that you can edit your own introduction. Don't forget to find your Wu-Tang name! I'll demonstrate how to do that now. Is everyone on Slack? Where would you go to find out how to get on it if you aren't already?
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>This is a brand new course, rewritten completely for the Apple Vision Pro for the second time this summer and centred around Spatial Computing. I'd love to hear all your feedback - just message me on the <a href="http://ual-cci.slack.com">CCI Slack</a>. I'm particularly looking out for good YouTube channels, so please share those if you find them.</div>
  <div>
    How to make use of the Disability services at CCI. You'll have already seen this on the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2025-2026/">GitHub readme.md</a> Don't wait until to your Masters to get support like I did. Support is available - make use of it, you'll be glad you did. Our main contact for the Apple Diploma is Caroline Huntley: c.huntley@arts.ac.uk</a>. <a href="https://artslondon-my.sharepoint.com/personal/k_atkinson_arts_ac_uk/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fk%5Fatkinson%5Farts%5Fac%5Fuk%2FDocuments%2FRecordings%2FMeeting%20with%20Katie%20Atkinson%2D20240904%5F211509%2DMeeting%20Recording%2Emp4&referrer=StreamWebApp%2EWeb&referrerScenario=AddressBarCopied%2Eview%2E8e7f0d86%2Debff%2D4f36%2D8724%2D5f1b430f6ebb">Last year's disability advisor, Katie Atkinson, has prepared a short 3 minute video, let's watch it together now</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    How to make use of the Library services at CCI. You'll have already seen this on the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2025-2026/">GitHub readme.md</a> - but I just wanted to say that Benelia is amazing! Make use of the library - you'll be glad you did. She'll be taking you on a tour of the library at 1400 (2pm)next Tuesday 7th October - do you all know where the library is?
  </div>
  <div>
    How you can get support around the cost of living crisis - <a href="https://canvas.arts.ac.uk/News/203126/supporting-our-students-through-the-cost-of-living-crisis?goBackUrl=">the following article was recently posted by UAL management</a>. If you are finding it tough, financially, physically, mentally or psychically, please don't hesitate to get in contact with me directly or <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/students/student-services/student-advice-service">the UAL student advice service</a>. They are great. The sooner you ask, the more support we can give. Don't suffer in silence. London can be a lonely place. <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/fees-and-funding/scholarships-search/university-hardship-fund">The hardship fund is something I'd recommend applying to if you even think you might need extra support</a>. <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/students/welcome/your-journey-to-UAL/get-support">The support team at UAL have made an intro video, let's watch it together now</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Are any of you interested in becoming the course rep? We must recruit two as soon as possible. Who's interested? Slack me if you are - great for your CV. No voting, just volunteering.
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://www.arts-su.com/voice/academic/staff-hub/register/">This is the link to register</a>, but please DM me on Slack first. The deadline for nominations is Friday 24th October (TBC). The course rep team asked me to say: "they will be asked to "purchase" a Course Rep membership on our website (but don't worry, it's free!)".</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    As a break, a presentation I gave recently for <a href="https://www.eyemagazine.com">Eye Magazine</a> on <a href="https://joelgethinlewis.com/presentations/TypeTuesday2025/">"Code is dead (long live code!)"</a>.
  </div>
  <div>My expectations of you through this year:
    <ul>
      <li>I expect you to be in person at CCI on the days that you have lectures - Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. I think it would be smart to make use of one of the three Vision Pro's in the afternoons of those days too. Even better - on Monday afternoons and Wednesday all day too!</li>
      <li>Make use of the other resources here at CCI. The students, the technicians, the researchers and the other lecturers.</li>
      <li>I expect you to be checking the CCI Slack at least once every day (apart from weekends). Download the iOS Slack app. Right now if you haven't already.</li>
      <li>You are expected to do 25 hours of work a week outside of lectures - i.e. Monday afternoons, Tuesday afternoons, Wednesday (all day), Thursday afternoons and Friday afternoons. Immerse yourself in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com">https://developer.apple.com</a> site - so many great resources there, I'll be making use of them extensively too!
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Tutorials are every <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2025-2026/wiki/Tutorial-Schedule">Monday morning from 1030-1300 on the CCI Slack</a>. They are 20 minutes long and can be about anything you like - the course, how you are, challenges you are having, ambitions, career advice, music selections. Whatever you like. I've got over 20 years of experience doing interesting things with computers</a>, so make use of that! Let's look at the schedule for next Monday and the one after.</div>
  <div>Important methods for succeeding on this course (and in general)</div>

  <div>What is the <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute">Creative Computing Institute (CCI)</a>?</div>
  <div>What you are we going to learn in this next year?</div>
  <div>We are going to learn about Creative Computing - a blend of Computational Thinking and Creative Coding.</div>
  <div>What is Computational Thinking?</div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>To learn how see problems at many levels (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction">abstraction</a>), break down problems (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science)">decomposition</a>), find the order in them (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_(psychology)">pattern recognition</a>), make solutions using a series of steps (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a>) and realise that you might be able to use that solution in lots of areas (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization">generalisation</a>).</li>
      <li>Most of all, to <b>learn</b> how to be <b>autodidacts</b>.</li>
      <li>First task: <b>what</b> is an <b>autodidact</b>? </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Look it up! What did you find?</div>
  <div>What is Creative Coding?</div>
  <div>I believe all coding is creative, as all life is creative. Specifically, creative coding is about blending creative techniques with software engineering. I want you to learn how to write code but also how you could use computing to change your practice. You can make lots of earth credits writing software, but I'm much more interested in giving you the tools to change yourself, your practice and the world.</div>
  <div>Next, a really important diagram.</div>
  <div>
    <img src="images/JimCampbellFormula_for_computer_art.jpg" />
    <div><a href="https://jimcampbell.tv/">Jim Campbell</a>'s formula for Computer Art. Realise that you can use things without understanding every aspect of them. All that computers do is process inputs into outputs. That's it.</div>
  </div>
  <div>What are we going to learn? What are we going to make? How?</div>
  <div>
    <div>We are going to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)">Swift</a>, which is <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#technology-top-paying-technologies">one of the most top paying programming languages in the world</a> as well as <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/app-store/developing-for-the-app-store/">audience of over 1.5 billion devices</a>. But it isn't about the money, it's about the impact. I want you to realise that your apps have just as much of a right to be on the home screen as anyone else's. Also, you are going to be amongst the first students in the world to be trained in making apps for the Vision Pro and learning about Spatial Computing.</div>
  </div>
  <div>But What are we going to make? How?</div>
  <div>Before we get into that, let's take a look at this article from 2019 from Allen Pike: <a href="https://allenpike.com/2019/the-supremacy-of-ar">"The Coming Supremacy of AR"</a>.</div>
  <div>We are going to make apps for the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>. We are going make apps by writing code using the <a href="https://www.swift.org">Swift programming language</a>. We are going to use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> to write Swift and we are going to use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/tools/">Reality Composer Pro</a> to import and author spatial content - images and text and sound and 3D objects. Reality Composer Pro makes spatial content using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Scene_Description">Universal Scene Description format (originally from Pixar)</a>. We are going to use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a> to build user interfaces for spatial apps and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit">RealityKit</a> to add spatial content to the world around us. We are going to use <a href="https://poly.cam">poly.cam</a> and <a href="http://www.blender.org">Blender</a> to make 3D objects. We are going to use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/">ARKit</a> to make <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/anchor">anchors</a> for spatial content - hands, images, objects, floors, ceilings, walls and rooms.</div>
  <div>Here is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLtRyuIJ_ET/?igsh=MWp4OGkxZTFxOGR5aQ==">a great example of how quickly you can make things with Reality Composer Pro</a>, from <a href="http://gregorywieber.com">Greg Wieber</a>, who also has a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dreamwieber">YouTube channel</a>.</div>
  <div>You are going to make two apps, a prototype for a caring app in a group in Spatial 1 and a playful app on your own in Spatial 2 (with help from me all along the way). You are also going to make your own ML model in ML 2. BTW, the idea of the playful and caring approach comes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN9S0HD8VH8">from this amazing presentation from David Graeber</a>. More about him in a moment.</div>
  <div>We are going to be building apps for visionOS, the operating system of the Apple Vision Pro. Let's take a look at the resources we'll be working through this year: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos</a>.</div>
  <div>The aim is to not make this <a href="https://vimeo.com/166807261">vision of a hyper-reality future</a> come true. The film was made 8 years ago(!) by <a href="http://km.cx">Keiichi Matsuda</a>. He's a critical designer who has founded a studio called <a href="https://liquid.city">Liquid City</a>. What does Critical Design mean to you?</div>
  <div>Apple Vision Pros are pretty large at the moment, with only two hours battery life. Things are going to move fast, see <a href="http://www.computationalimaging.org/publications/holographicAR/">this paper</a> from the team at <a href="https://www.computationalimaging.org">the Stanford Computational Imaging Lab</a>.</div>
  <div>While not part of the course, consider entering <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/">The Swift Student Challenge</a> - previous prizes have included a trip to Apple headquarters to see the next <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">World Wide Developers Conference</a>.</div>
  <div>There are three units in each Block, lasting half the academic year. Coding, Spatial and ML. Coding 1 will teach you how to write in Swift and make apps using SwiftUI. Coding 2 will continue that process, learning more APIs from Apple, including more SwiftUI, RealityKit and ARKit. Spatial 1 will take you through making a prototype app in a group, learning RealityKit along the way. Spatial 2 will take you through making a full app on your own, learning even more RealityKit and ARKit. ML 1 will explore existing Machine Learning models and ML 2 will take you through making new ones.</div>
  <div>
    When learning to code and make apps for a brand new platform, there will always be a chicken and egg problem. Meaning I can't teach you everything at once, so sometimes you'll have to take what I say on trust, knowing that we will return to flesh out the details later. As I said before, this is a brand new course, revised for the first time over this summer, so things are going to change as we go. We might over or under run on lectures, I'll keep things up to date from week to week, please be patient with me!
  </div>
  <div>
    I'd really suggest keeping a diary of your progress and learnings along the way. You could store this information on your GitHub page - ask me how to do this in a tutorial if you are interested. Talking about what you've learnt and sharing that publicly is a great way of proving you know what you say you can do and a great way of getting a job. Here are two great GitHub pages that do just that: <a href="https://github.com/bluekamandy/SwiftUI-Cheat-Sheet">https://github.com/bluekamandy/SwiftUI-Cheat-Sheet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bluekamandy/Exploration-of-ARKit">https://github.com/bluekamandy/Exploration-of-ARKit</a>. Let's take a look at <a href="http://www.bluekamandy.com/">Blue's homepage</a>. <a href="https://github.com/bluekamandy">Look at where they are working now</a>. Another person who is great at this is <a href="https://interconnected.org">Matt Webb</a>, let's take a look at his homepage and recent projects. I also recommend watching his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDP24ARdGDA">Things 2024 lecture - it's a brilliant 30 minutes of showing experiments instead of his "thought leadership"</a> - incidentally this is <b>exactly</b> how they do things at Apple - no "vision" only prototypes. Why is this better?
  </div>
  <div>Remember, my main aim is to turn you all into autodidacts that can learn anything for themselves in order to make whatever they want to make. Most of all, I want you to support each other.</div>
  <div>Some situating yourself in the world resources:</div>
  <div>
    We are in a stressful time at the moment. Here are some resources for situating yourself in the world, and how to keep going, set up a studio (if you want) and what you (maybe) should be doing:

The first half of the year will be all about making an app prototype in a group and the second half of the year will be all about making an app for release on your own. We'll have an end of year show with the rest of CCI and a presentation at the Apple UK headquarters at Battersea!
