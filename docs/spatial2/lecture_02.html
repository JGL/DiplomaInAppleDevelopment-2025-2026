	<div>Hi! 👻</div>
	<div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
	<div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
	<div>Let's start with everyone showing their 1 minute presentations on:
		<ol>
			<li>Which anchor they are going to concentrate on for the rest of the year</li>
			<li>How the anchor relates to their BA or wider practice</li>
			<li>Their initial thought for a playful app to make</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<div>Great! Let's continue by watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMsF31NdNc">this presentation from Nintendo about the making of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>.</div>
	<div>Studio time! Please start working on your first prototypes - I'll come round individually. Perhaps they should be paper prototypes first? Do you need craft materials?</div>
	<div>
		Thanks! Please watch all of the content from today's lecture as homework.<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
