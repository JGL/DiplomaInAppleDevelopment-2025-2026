	<div>Hi! 👻</div>
	<div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
	<div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
	<div>Let's begin by studying what goes into a visionOS icon:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons/">Apple's Human Interface Guidelines section on app icons</a>.</li>
			<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/configuring-your-app-icon">Apple's Xcode article on "Configuring your app icon
					"</a>.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.createwithswift.com/adapting-your-app-icon-to-visionos/">CreateWithSwift.com article on adapting your app icon for visionOS</a>. By the way, <a href="https://www.createwithswift.com/make-it-spatial/">CreateWithSwift.com has a whole series of great visionOS related articles</a>.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
		Let's move onto <a href="https://developer.apple.com/testflight/">TestFlight</a>. Let's watch this <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/tech-talks/110343/">tech talk on "Get Started with TestFlight"</a>, followed by this WWDC23 video: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10012/">"Explore App Store Connect for spatial computing"</a>. Finally, let's work through the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/welcome-to-app-distribution">Welcome to app distribution</a> section of Apple's Develop in Swift Tutorials. You must have a valid <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/">Apple Developer Program</a> membership for this. Do you?
	</div>
	<div>Let's finish by watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-dPDsLTrTE">this presentation from Nintendo about the making of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</div>
	<div>
		Thanks! Please re-watch all of the content from today's lecture as homework and prepare to present progress on your prototype apps - have you built a paper prototype yet?<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
