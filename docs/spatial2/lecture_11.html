	<div>Hi! 👻</div>
	<div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
	<div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
	<div>
		Today will be a deep dive into two subjects:
		<ol>
			<li>Swift Charts</li>
			<li>Concurrency in SwiftUI</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<div>Let's start by watching this presentation from WWDC22: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10136/">Hello Swift Charts</a>, before continuing to this presentation from WWDC22: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10137/">Swift Charts: Raise the bar</a>. Next, from WWDC23: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10037/">Explore pie charts and interactivity in Swift Charts</a>. Next, from WWDC24: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10155/">Swift Charts: Vectorized and function plots</a>. Finally, from WWDC25: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/313/">Bring Swift Charts to the third dimension</a>.</div>
	<div>
		Next, let's move onto a new topic with this video from WWDC25: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/268/">Embracing Swift concurrency</a>, then continue with this video, also from WWDC25: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/266/">Explore concurrency in SwiftUI</a>.
	</div>
	<div>Studio time! Please start working - I'll come round individually.</div>
	<div>
		Thanks! Please watch all of the content from today's lecture as homework and prepare to present your revised project thoughts next week. Don't forget, it's completely fine to present your app by making a screen recording, or even better, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/apple-vision-pro/tanf4ca9ada2/visionos">a live demo in class by streaming to my laptop</a>.<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
