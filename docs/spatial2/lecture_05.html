	<div>Hi! 👻</div>
	<div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
	<div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
	<div>Do you remember the Tiny Treasure Trove app from lecture 1 of Coding 2?</div>
	<div>Let's re-familiarise ourselves by skipping through this video from WWDC25: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/287/">What’s new in RealityKit</a>.</div>
	<div>Now, let's all download the linked example code: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/integrating-virtual-objects-with-your-environment">Integrating virtual objects with your environment aka Tiny Treasure Trove</a>. First thing to do is to get it building on your computers - do you get a build error too? What version of macOS and Xcode are you running? I have a fix, remember?</div>
	<div>Let's look at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/manipulationcomponent">the documentation for ManipulationComponent</a>. Let's look at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/component">the list of all RealityKit components</a>.</div>
	<div>Let's review this sample code on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/transforming-realitykit-entities-with-gestures">Transforming RealityKit entities using gestures</a> - this example uses the standard system gestures of drag, rotate and scale.</div>
	<div>For reference, let's look at how complicated things used to be before ManipulationComponent was introduced: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/responding-to-gestures-on-an-entity">Responding to gestures on an entity</a>.</div>
	<div>Step Into Vision has a <a href="https://stepinto.vision/learn-visionos/#system-gestures">whole series of articles on gestures</a>.</div>
	<div>Great! Do you know who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Sakurai">Masahiro Sakurai</a> is? Let's take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_en">their YouTube channel</a>.</div>

		Thanks! Please watch all of the content from today's lecture as homework and prepare to present your revised project thoughts after the Easter holidays, including your working app, centred around your key moment. Take this opportunity to make big progress on your app! Don't forget, it's completely fine to present your app by making a screen recording, or even better, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/apple-vision-pro/tanf4ca9ada2/visionos">a live demo in class by streaming to my laptop</a>.<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
